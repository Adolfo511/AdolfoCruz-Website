        <div class="subheading mb-5">Business AdministrationðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello my name is Adolfo Cruz. I would like to graduate with a B.S and obtain my M.B.A in Business Administration. Business has so many opportunities in todayâ€™s society that can ensure stable careers for those with ambition and motivation. I have dedicated so much time in making sure I do the best I can possibly do in my education so that I make myself stand out. I know that many people want to do the best they can, but for me it is doing the best I can while assisting those around me with the knowledge Iâ€™ve gained. In the next 10 years I would like to be the head of a company where I can become an inspiration for future Latinx youth who are interested in business as well.
<br><br>

        Aside from my education, volunteering is something I believe is very important. For example, I work with Innercity Struggle, a non profit that informs low socioeconomic communities on the local proceedings that are ongoing as well as educate students on how to become self sufficient. Before graduating High School, I represented my high school and attend many community meetings and delegations to speak on behalf of students.
Furthermore, I would work with BSS (Brothers Sons Selvs), an organization focused on community organizing and the lives of people affected by injustice. Volunteering helps build leadership skills among its oneself and members by engaging them in advocacy. One of these experiences that plays a key role in my ambission to pursure my education was when I was the ambassador of the East Side of Los Angeles and was in charge of distributing surveys for community evaluation as well as representing the East Side in community discussions and issues since many students were not aware of the impact being impossed on them by others who could not connect to many of their situations.<br><br>

        I believe business is the key to a good community. My community is one of many low socioeconomic communities struggling to keep small businesses open. Many people are affected and are forced to shop in larger supermarkets. Small businesses are key in creating a community. Not only do they help maintain jobs in the community but they also help the community build a sense of pride within the people. This pride can go a long way such as creating unity. I would want to start scholarships and internships where students in these communities can take advantage and be able to build off the foundation set for them. These opportunities I believe should be able to motivate students to create changes in their own community to not only better it but create a path that future students can take. I will make sure those around me achieve their goals while also accomplishing mine.
